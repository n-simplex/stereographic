!! Stereographic Projection

This is a piece of p5.js code which, when run, shows a live interactable projection of a dodecahedron onto the plane along with circles inscribed in the faces. It was written for an article "Circles Touching Circles" for [this blog](https://n-simplex.github.io/) and can be found working [here](https://n-simplex.github.io/stereographic).
